/*
When you run `cargo add rusqlite`, it adds the `rusqlite` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file with the default configuration. However, `rusqlite` has additional optional features that you can enable if you need them.
### Including All Features of `rusqlite`
To include all features, you can use the `--features` flag when adding the crate:

```bash
cargo add rusqlite --features "bundled"
```

### Explanation of Features
1. bundled:
   - This feature bundles SQLite with the `rusqlite` crate, meaning it includes SQLiteâ€™s C library as part of your Rust project.
   - It's useful if you don't want to rely on a system-installed version of SQLite.

2. other optional features:
   - Some crates might have additional feature flags (like support for specific database functionalities or performance optimizations).
   - For `rusqlite`, you can look at the available features in its documentation or by running:

```bash
cargo readme |sql-cli.compile=final output provided a breakdown in.documentation support

You can find and enable the features for `rusqlite` by checking its documentation on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rusqlite). Here's how to include all features or specific ones:

### Enabling All Available Features
The `rusqlite` crate does not provide a pre-defined "all features" option, but you can manually specify the features you want to include. Run the following command:

```bash
cargo add rusqlite --features "bundled sqlcipher"
```

### List of Common Features in `rusqlite`
As of the latest version, here are some key features you might enable:
1. `bundled`: Includes the SQLite library statically bundled with your Rust code.
2. `sqlcipher`: Adds support for SQLCipher, enabling encrypted SQLite databases.
3. `serde_json`: Adds support for working with JSON values in SQLite.
4. `time`: Adds support for `chrono` and `time` types.
5. `r2d2`: Adds support for connection pooling using the `r2d2` crate.

### Modifying `Cargo.toml` Manually
If you prefer to add features manually in the `Cargo.toml` file, edit it as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]
rusqlite = { version = "0.29.0", features = ["bundled", "serde_json", "sqlcipher"] }
```

### Check Features in Crate Documentation
1. Visit the `rusqlite` [documentation on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rusqlite).
2. Look for the Features section in the README or documentation.

---

### When Should You Use Features?
- Default: The default configuration is enough for simple CRUD operations and SQLite support.
- Additional Features: Use features like `sqlcipher` if you need encryption or `bundled` if you don't want to rely on system-installed SQLite.
