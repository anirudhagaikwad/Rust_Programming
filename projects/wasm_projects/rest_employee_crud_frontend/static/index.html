<!-- if you're not using trunk or prefer to handle the HTML and WebAssembly setup manually, you can create the index.html file yourself. Here's how it works:
Without trunk: You would manually handle the connection between your WebAssembly code and the browser using wasm-bindgen and ensure the proper loading of the generated .wasm and JavaScript files.
With trunk: trunk automates many of these steps, such as generating index.html with the right configurations for loading WebAssembly and bundling everything together. -->
